# Intro
This is a project that has a focus on developing a smart door lock using knowledge gathered from the courses Softweare Technology for Internet of things + Software system analysis and varification.

Our initial approach to this is to use the following technologies for different aspects of the project.
## For the door lock client (esp32)
- Embassy rust
## Server hub for internal to external communication
- Yet to be determined.
- Tech in considuration
  - MQTT
  - Elixir
  - Javascript
  - C#
  - REST APi
## APP
- Expo for React native dev
- Expo packages for server comunication


# Approach


# Recomended workflow and tech for Architecure
For architecure and diagrams id recommend using VScode with md extetions and Diagrams.net extention also.
This alows you to both write and edit the diagrams in one place and push them onto the main branch as you'd do with code also

- Diagrams.net (extention)
- Markdown (extention)

# Recomended tech for server
- Biome.js (extention in vscode)
- Bun (required for the framework)

# Recomended tech for App
- Expo cli

# Recomended tech for ESP32
- Rust with rustup, rustc and cargo
- Rust analysier (extention)
